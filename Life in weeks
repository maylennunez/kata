Create a function that tell us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
For this challenge assume there are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year. 


function lifeInWeeks(age) {
    var yearsRemaining = 90 - age;
    var days = yearsRemaining * 365;
    var months = yearsRemaining * 12;
    var weeks = yearsRemaining * 52;
    console.log(" You have " + days + " days, " + weeks + " weeks and " + months + " months left.")
}
lifeInWeeks(56)
